# Automobile Sales Visualisation Analysis
In this project I was tasked to create plots to understand the historical trends in automobile sales during the recession period. 

## Description
The data set used for this project contains *historical_automobile_sales* data, representing automobile sales and related variables during the recession and non-recession period. The dataset includes columns such as Date, Automobile_Sales, GDP, Unemployment_Rate and many others. To see the data set that was used for this project, you an find it [here](https://github.com/YaasirM/Automobile_sales_visualisation/blob/main/assets/historical_automobile_sales.csv)

## Task
The task of this project is to do a few of the following:
1. The affect the recessions had on automobile sales
2. How the sales of different automobile types were affected by the recession
3. To confirm if there was a correlation between the recssion, sales and pricing
4. How advertisement expenditure was affected by the recession
5. The affect of unemployment rate for vehicle sales

To get started, I initially imported the desired packages (matplotlib, pandas, seaborn and numpy) before importing the dataset. I then confirmed all the columns that were required were present in the imported dataset before starting with the visualisation analysis.

## Automobile Sales vs Recession
I started by creating a line graph 

## Jupyter notebook
The analysis and modelling were performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. You can find the complete notebook [here](https://github.com/YaasirM/Automobile_sales_visualisation/blob/main/assets/Automobile_sales_visualisation_notebook.ipynb)
